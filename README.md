# Number Guessing Game in Java 🎯

This is a simple Java console-based number guessing game.

## 🔹 How It Works

- The program randomly picks a number between 1 and 100.
- The user tries to guess the number.
- The program gives hints after each guess — whether the correct number is higher or lower.
- The game ends once the user correctly guesses the number.
- Displays the total number of attempts taken.
